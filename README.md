# Epic Weapons

Epic Weapons is a datapack for Minecraft 1.17+ that adds lore to your weapons
as you use them. The more hostile mobs of a certain type you kill, the more the
lore of your weapon develops.

For instance, as you kill Skeletons with your sword, it will become a Skeleton
Slayer weapon, then progress through Bone Rattler become The Bone Mealer,
The Skull Crusher and then finally The Pulverizer.

The pack is currently in an Alpha state.
